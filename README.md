# ML_PROJECTS_FROM_SCRATCH
BY : KRRISH SINGH
<br>
This repository contains multiple basic level projects made using predictive models like regressors, classifiers etc, built from scratch. It mainly focuses on building small models from scratch.
This repo contains folder with required data to make beginner level projects for those who want to get experience of writing their own code for models instead of just using from library.
<ol>
  1. Insurance amount using Linear Regression : 
      Use info such as (age, sex, bmi, kids, smoke) to predict insurance cost for a person.
  2. Crop Yield Prediction using Polynomial Regression : 
      Use info like (Area,Item,Year,average_rain_fall_mm_per_year,pesticides_tonnes,avg_temp) to predict hg/ha_yield.
